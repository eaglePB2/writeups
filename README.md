Welcome, this is my archive of personal writeups that I had taken / practiced / or even some of the questions I come up myself from various contests.

The solution there are mostly polished, which differ than my code during competitions.

Most of the solution is written in Python, since it is fastest to implement while being more and more popular in ML / DL phases.

As be cautious: most of the solution breaks the production rule to gain maximum performance, or we can say, the worst possible method while suffice the time and space constraints. (Meanwhile I would try my best to write writeups while following the production rule, unless the contraints forces to break the rules.)

Example: bird sightseeing given only 5 types of birds, I will use arr = \[0,0,0,0,0] and count frequency instead of creating an enumerator to capture all unique values and frequency, as the before is straightforward and faster to implement.
