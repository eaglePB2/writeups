# General Formatting Title

Just a reminder for me, if I want to format anything.

<kbd>KEY</kbd> -> Used for Input variables, such as <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>x</kbd>, `n`

&#x20;$$f(x) = formulae$$ -> Math formula, if needed, also used on constraints.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Each Question should consist of:

* Question
* Constraints
* Input and Output Type
* Tabs for Sample Inputs & Outputs
* Accordion for Proposed Solution
{% endhint %}

Only collects the competitions I had taken, and hopefully the solutions are correct (huh)

aka, I won't collect leetcode related codes as they are elementary.
