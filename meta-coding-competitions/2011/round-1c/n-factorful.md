# N-Factorful

## Question

A number is called **n**-factorful if it has exactly **n** distinct prime factors. Given positive integers **a**, **b**, and **n**, your task is to find the number of integers between **a** and **b**, inclusive, that are **n**-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.

### Input Format

Your input will consist of a single integer **T** followed by a newline and **T** test cases. Each test cases consists of a single line containing integers **a**, **b**, and **n** as described above.

### Constraints

$$
T = 20
$$

$$
1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^7
$$

$$
0 ≤ n ≤ 10
$$

### Output Format

Output for each test case one line containing the number of **n**-factorful integers in \[**a**, **b**].

### Sample Inputs:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Input 0" %}
#### Input

```
5
1 3 1
1 10 2
1 10 3
1 100 3
1 1000 0
```

#### Output

```
2
2
0
8
1
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
