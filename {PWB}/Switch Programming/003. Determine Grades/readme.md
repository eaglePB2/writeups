Write a Program to Find Grade of a Student Using Switch Case.  
The user needs to enter the subject number and the program must return the Grade of the subject based on the number.   
If a student enters the number between 90 to 100 then our program must return the Grade A or Excellent, similarly for other ranges numbers. 
To get the help I have a Number to grade conversion table this may help you to find the proper logic and roadmap for our program to Calculate Grade Using Switch Statement:

| Numbers in Marks  | Grade Conversion |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 90-100  | A  |
| 80-89  | B  |
| 70-79  | C  |
| 60-69  | D  |
| 50-59  | E  |
| 40-49  | E-  |
| <40  | F  |

### Sample 1
`Input`
```
1000
```

`Output`
```
Error:  Don't Be Smart Enter your Marks Between Limit.
```

### Sample 2
`Input`
```
95
```

`Output`
```
A
```

### Sample 3
`Input`
```

```

`Output`
```
