# Codey and Symbol

## Question

Codey was working on an equation but accidentally spilled water on its notes, blurring one of the symbols. Now, it canâ€™t tell the correct relationship between the two sides of its equation.

The equation is given as:



$$
a - (\frac{b}{c}) ? (\frac{d}{e}) - f
$$

Help Codey find the relationship `?`.&#x20;

Print `>` if the left side is bigger, `<` if the right side is bigger, otherwise `=`.

### Input Format

The first line contains 6 values, $$a,b,c,d,e,f$$.

### Constraints

$$
0 \le a, b, c, d, e, f \le 10^5
$$

$$
c, e \ne 0
$$

### Output Format

Print a single character:

* $$>$$, if left side is larger.
* $$<$$, if left side is smaller.
* $$=$$, if both sides are equal.

### Sample Inputs:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Input 0" %}
#### Input

```
5 6 2 8 4 1
```

#### Output

```
>
```

#### Explanation

Left Side: $$5 - (\frac{6}{2}) = 2$$

Right Side: $$(\frac{8}{4}) - 1 = 1$$

$$2>1$$, therefore output `>`.

<summary>Solution - Rounding Trap</summary>

This question is more like testing if you know programming rounding issues.

In some reason, when you divide a value, the number would get different when it rounds too many significant values, which is in default. (which we called, float rounding error)

Therefore, when comparing, don't forget to round to 4 values or fewer, so that the comparison will be correct.

Here's the code:

{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```python
a, b, c, d, e, f = map(int, input().strip().split())
lhs = a - (b / c)
rhs = (d / e) - f

if round(lhs, 4) > round(rhs, 4):
    print(">")
elif round(rhs, 4) > round(lhs, 4):
    print("<")
else:
    print("=")
```
{% endcode %}
