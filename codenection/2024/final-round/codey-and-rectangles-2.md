# Codey and Rectangles 2

## Question

Codey was working on an equation but accidentally spilled water on its notes, blurring one of the symbols. Now, it canâ€™t tell the correct relationship between the two sides of its equation.

The equation is given as:



$$
a - (\frac{b}{c}) ? (\frac{d}{e}) - f
$$

Help Codey find the relationship `?`.&#x20;

Print `>` if the left side is bigger, `<` if the right side is bigger, otherwise `=`.

### Input Format

The first line contains 6 values, $$a,b,c,d,e,f$$.

### Constraints

$$
0 \le a, b, c, d, e, f \le 10^5
$$

$$
c, e \ne 0
$$

### Output Format

Print a single character:

* $$>$$, if left side is larger.
* $$<$$, if left side is smaller.
* $$=$$, if both sides are equal.

### Sample Inputs:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Input 0" %}
#### Input

```
5 6 2 8 4 1
```

#### Output

```
>
```

#### Explanation

Left Side: $$5 - (\frac{6}{2}) = 2$$

Right Side: $$(\frac{8}{4}) - 1 = 1$$

$$2>1$$, therefore output `>`.

<summary>Solution - Easier Rectangles?</summary>

This question is even easier than preliminary round, [Codey and Rectangles](../preliminary-round/codey-and-rectangles.md).

Basically we can solve it using simple formulas.

Step 1: Find the area of both rectangles.

Given Rectangle A = $$(x_1, y_1)$$ to $$(x_2, y_2)$$, Rectangle B = $$(x_3, y_3)$$ to $$(x_4, y_4)$$.

The sum of the area of both rectangles are:

$$|[x_2-x_1]*[y_2-y_1]| + |[x_4-x_3] * [y_4-y_3]|$$

Step 2: Find the **Overlap** area of both rectangles.

The overlap length/width can be solved using this formula:

length: $$max(0, min(x_2,x_4)-min(x_1,x_3))$$

width: $$max(0, min(y_2,y_4) - min(y_1,y_3))$$

Lastly, multiply them to get the overlap area of both rectangles.

Step 3: Add them up!

It's simple, just area of both rectangles - overlap area of both rectangles. Finally, you have solved this problem!

Step 4: Generalize the formula into 2\~100 rectangles



Here's my code:

```python
// Some code
```
